# 🍑 MANGEMON.UK – The Most Unhinged Link Hub on the Internet

> Welcome to **Mangemon.uk**, the beautifully cursed alternative to Linktree.  
> It means **“eat my ass” in French**, slay.

## 🤔 What Even Is This?

Mangemon.uk is like Linktree, but if Linktree drank 4 Red Bulls, got dumped, and started making websites at 2am.

It’s a link hub. For all your junk. And I mean *all* of it.  
Your art? Sure. Your VAPR? Why not. Your SoundCloud from 2016? Absolutely.  
Put every cursed fragment of your online presence in one place and call it ✨aesthetic✨.
